# Overview
The code creates a WiFi network with the name "saiboard" and the password "saiboard". \
It then runs a server that accepts TCP connections. \
The server responds to requests to turn the LED on or off, and it also sends sensor data back to the client. \
For more details, please see the accompanying [notebook](https://github.com/miliar/saiboard/blob/main/software/esp32s3/test_basic_components.ipynb).
